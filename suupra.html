<h2> More About Nissan 240SX </h2>
<p><strong> The 240SX</strong> is a sports car that was introduced to the North American market by Nissan in 1988 for the following model year. It replaced the outgoing 200SX (S12) model. Most of the 240SX were equipped with the 2.4-liter inline 4 engine (KA24E from 1989–1990 and KA24DE from 1991–1999). The KA24E had a single overhead cam and KA24DE had dual overhead cams. Two distinct generations of the 240SX, the S13 (1989–1995) the S14 (1995-1999) were produced based on the Nissan S platform.

The 240SX is closely related to other S platform based vehicles, such as the Japanese-market Silvia and <strong>180SX</strong>, and the European-market 200SX. Although their names are similar, the 240SX is unrelated to the 240Z or the 280ZX.

Although it is long out of production, it is still popular in drifting.</p>
