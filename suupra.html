<h2> More About Nissan 240SX </h2>
<p><strong> The 240SX</strong> is a sports car that was introduced to the North American market by Nissan in 1988 for the following model year. It replaced the outgoing 200SX (S12) model. Most of the 240SX were equipped with the 2.4-liter inline 4 engine (KA24E from 1989–1990 and KA24DE from 1991–1999). The KA24E had a single overhead cam and KA24DE had dual overhead cams. Two distinct generations of the 240SX, the S13 (1989–1995) the S14 (1995-1999) were produced based on the Nissan S platform.

The 240SX is closely related to other S platform based vehicles, such as the Japanese-market Silvia and <strong>180SX</strong>, and the European-market 200SX. Although their names are similar, the 240SX is unrelated to the 240Z or the 280ZX.

Although it is long out of production, it is still popular in drifting.</p>
<h3>My FAVORITE Generation</h3>
<p> The 240SX was released in the spring of 1994 as a 1995 model. The hatchback and convertible body styles were eliminated, leaving only the coupe. 
The wheelbase car grew 2 in (51 mm) and the track width was also increased, while the overall length of the vehicle was slightly shorter than the previous generation. 
The curb weight of the vehicle increased by about 80 lb (36 kg) relative to the 1994 model.[2] Dual air bags were added and the automatic seatbelts were replaced with common manual type. 
The pop-up headlights were removed in favor of fixed lamps. Though the general layout remained the same, almost all parts were redesigned to the extent that very few parts are interchangeable. The chassis was changed slightly to increase stiffness (Nissan claimed 50% torsional, 100% bending rigidity increase)[citation needed] and utilized higher rear strut mounts. 
The fuel tank, previously located at the rear end under the trunk floor, now sat in front of the rear suspension and behind the rear seats.</p>
